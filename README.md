# Pedestrian-detection
Simple Pedestrian-Detection using Machine Learning

## TO RUN THIS MODEL YOURSELF:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download this dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthika95/pedestrian-detection)
3. Extract the dataset to your repository folder.
4. Open the [Model jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MaitriSavla2003/Pedestrian-detection/blob/main/Model.ipynb)
5. Run this notebook
6. Run the [gui2.py](https://github.com/MaitriSavla2003/Pedestrian-detection/blob/main/gui2.py) file.
7.  Upload the image you want to test.
8.  Click on "Detect" button.
9.  View the result.

#### NOTE: The model saved was exceeding the size limit. Therefore,did not push "Pedestrian_Detection2.h5" file for direct gui file execution.
